.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to set and display soundcard mixer device levels. The list of mixer 
devices that may be modified are:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
vol, bass, treble, synth, pcm, speaker, line, mic, cd, mix,
pcm2, rec, igain, ogain, line1, line2, line3, dig1, dig2, dig3,
phin, phout, video, radio, and monitor.
.Ed
.Pp
Without any arguments,
.Nm
displays information and the current settings for all supported devices.
If the
.Ar dev
argument is specified,
.Nm
displays only the values for
.Ar dev .
.Pp
To modify a device's volume, the optional
.Ar lvol 
and/or
.Ar rvol
values have to be specified. The values have to be normalized 32-bit floats
(0.0 to 1.0). Omitting
.Ar dev
will change the value of the main channel (usually "vol").
If the the left or right volume values are prefixed with
.Cm +
or
.Cm - ,
the value following will be used as a relative adjustment, modifying the
current settings by the amount specified.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/mixerN -compact
.It Pa /dev/mixerN
the mixer device, where
.Ar N
is the number of that device, for example
.Ar /dev/mixer0 .
PCM cards and mixers have a 1:1 relationship, which means that 
.Ar mixer0
is the mixer for
.Ar pcm0 
and so on.

\" TODO: write about the rest of the program.
